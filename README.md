# starstruk
Creates a starfield from real star data in a Blender scene.
Using a refined and cleaned version of the HYG database (http://astronexus.com/hyg), this script reads out a stars apparent magnitude, color value and polar coordinates, and creates a triangle facing the scene origin with these parameters at a predetermined distance. This is done for each star in the list above a certain magnitude.
